# CordHost

A simple little social media app I made in 8 hours. Uses Expressjs, NEDB, crypto, and bcrypt.

# Installation

1: Download source code. \n
2: Download nodejs
3: Run this command: npm i express express-session cookie-parser bcrypt nedb helmet (Make sure you are in the web app directory when you do this, or the modules will not be read by the program)
4: Run this command: node server.js
