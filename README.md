# CordHost

A simple little social media app I made in 8 (It was functional in 8 hours, but I worked on it more) hours. Uses Expressjs, NEDB, crypto, and bcrypt.

# Installation

1: Download source code. <br />
2: Download nodejs. <br />
3: Run this command: npm i express express-session cookie-parser bcrypt nedb helmet (Make sure you are in the web app directory when you do this, or the modules will not be read by the program). <br />
4: Run this command: node server.js <br />
